# SELCAL Generator
This file is for generating SELCAL (SelCal or selective-calling, more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SELCAL)) codes. It follow the SELCAL code rules which are:
1. Four letters which are from A to S excluding I, N and O.
1. The letters within a given pair are written or transmitted in alphabetical order.
1. A given letter can be used only once in a SELCAL code; letters may not be repeated. For example, it cannot be AA-CF as A repeats.

This generator does not check if the code is available to use. It only generates them according to rules.
